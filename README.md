# K2MAXKlipper
Klipper installation on Anycubic Kobra 2 MAX with minimal cost or modification

A simple, easy and cost effective solution to install full mainline Klipper on your Anycubic Kobra 2 MAX which will keep as many original parts as possible by only replacing the mainboard with a genuine Anycubic mainboard from a Kobra 2 and minor physical modifications.

This is a great project for a weekend when you can focus and will not need your printer.  Everything CAN be done in one day but it is best not to rush.  Take your time and be VERY clear with what you are doing. Read the instructions below multiple times to be sure you are familiar, and comfortable, with all steps before you begin to do ANYTHING.  If you have modified 3D printers previously this should be a very simple mod for you.  If you have not modified a 3D printer before, but you enjoy using simple hand tools, you should have no trouble.  Just go slow, read the instructions, and pay very close attention to what you are doing.  Take pictures along the way to help you keep track of the way things are BEFORE you disconnect anything in case you wish to reverse any of the mods.  But most of all HAVE FUN!!!!!!

Please pay special attention to the section on the accelerometers.  This is an OPTIONAL modification.  You do NOT have to remove the bed accelerometer if you do not want to but at this point in time BOTH the bed and printhead accelerometers will be disabled by this modification.  This project is not fully completed and the intention is to get the stock accelerometers to work with the replacement mainboard...eventually.  Until then a USB-C accelerometer (I use a BTT S2DW) is a simple solution to be able to set your input shaping calibrations.
